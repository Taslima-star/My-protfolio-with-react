      <h1>About Me </h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm a passionate and creative <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong> with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies.
        I love building modern, responsive websites and web applications that provide great user experiences and solve real-world problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the frontend, I work with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and UI libraries to craft beautiful and interactive user interfaces.
        On the backend, I’m experienced with <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong>, and <strong>PHP</strong>, enabling me to build robust APIs and server-side logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy learning new technologies and continuously improving my skills. Whether it's working on a solo project or collaborating in a team, I'm always focused on writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and take on exciting development challenges. Let’s build something amazing together!
